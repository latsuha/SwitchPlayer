 SwitchPlayer uses the browser as a video player to play local video files.

The essence of this player is that the playhead does not reset after switching between videos, so the next video continues in the same place.

This player is suitable for synchronized videos of the same event shot from different cameras.

If the videos are not synchronized, they can be slightly aligned by adding/subtracting a delay in the context menu (right-click).
