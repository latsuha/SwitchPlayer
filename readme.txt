**SwitchPlayer** is a browser-based video player that plays local video files.

Its key feature is that the playhead does not reset when switching between videos, meaning the next video continues from the same point in time. 

This makes it suitable for playing back synchronized recordings of the same event taken by different cameras (from different angles). 

If the videos aren't perfectly synchronized, you can add or subtract a delay via the context menu (right-click).
